# Skill: AI Ethics & Bias Audit

Expertise in ensuring AI-generated marketing content is ethical, unbiased, and compliant with emerging AI regulations (EU AI Act, etc.).

## Core Capabilities
- **Bias Detection**: Identifying gender, racial, or socio-economic biases in AI-generated copy or strategies.
- **Hallucination Check**: Cross-referencing AI claims against verified datasets.
- **Privacy Compliance**: Ensuring CRM data handling follows "Privacy by Design" principles in AI workflows.
- **Brand Safety**: Filtering out controversial or harmful associations in automated content generation.
- **Transparency Reporting**: Creating documentation on how AI decisions are made within a campaign.

## Operational Logic
1. **Input Shield**: Check the initial prompt for potential bias triggers.
2. **Output Audit**: Run a "Red Team" analysis on the generated content.
3. **Regulation Cross-check**: Verify against GDPR/EU AI Act checklists.
4. **Final Scoring**: Assign an Ethics/Safety score before publication.
