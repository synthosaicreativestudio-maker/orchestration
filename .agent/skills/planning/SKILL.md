# Planning & Reasoning


## Core Skills
1.  **Task Decomposition:** Break abstract goals into concrete technical steps.
2.  **Dependency Mapping:** Identify launch order (DB -> API -> Frontend).
3.  **Critical Path Analysis:** Identify blocking steps.
4.  **Strategic Adjusting:** Adapt plans when the initial approach fails (Plan B).
5.  **Risk Forecasting:** Anticipate problems (e.g., API downtime) before coding.
6.  **Success Criteria Definition:** Define "Definition of Done" for every subtask.
7.  **Resource Estimation:** Estimate complexity and step count.

## Instructions
- ALWAYS start complex tasks by creating a `task.md` or `implementation_plan.md`.
- Never proceed blindly; if a step is ambiguous, stop and plan.
- Update the plan as you discover new information.
