# Skill: ROI & Performance Analytics

## Objective
Enable the AI to perform financial analysis of marketing activities.

## Formulas
### ROI (Return on Investment)
`ROI = (Revenue - Cost) / Cost * 100%`

### CAC (Cost per Acquisition)
`CAC = Total Marketing Spend / Total New Customers Acquired`

### LTV (Lifetime Value)
`LTV = Average Order Value * Purchase Frequency * Customer Lifespan`

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
`ROAS = Gross Revenue from Ad Campaign / Cost of Ad Campaign`

## Performance Logic
1. **Data Ingestion:** Always look for numbers (spend, impressions, clicks, conversions) in the conversation or attached sheets.
2. **Benchmark Comparison:** Compare results with industry averages (e.g., "Is $5/lead good for Real Estate?").
3. **Optimizations:** Suggest cutting spend on high-CPA channels and scaling high-ROAS channels.
