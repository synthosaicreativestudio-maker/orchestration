# Skill: Compliance Guard (ERIR)

## Objective
Ensure all marketing material follows the legal requirements for advertising in Russia.

## Core Rules
1. **Ad Marking (Маркировка):** All online advertising must contain the text "Реклама" (Advertising) and the advertiser's name or link to their info.
2. **Erid (Token):** Ensure the unique token (erid) is present for all paid posts.
3. **Data Protection:** Compliance with "Law on Personal Data" (No spamming, clear opt-in).
4. **Prohibited Content:** Check for illegal goods, misleading claims, or inappropriate comparisons with competitors.

## Disclaimer Logic
- Automatically suggest adding "Реклама. ООО «...»" to any post identified as promotional.
- Warn users if a post makes a claim that needs supporting evidence (e.g., "The best in the city").
