# Premium UX/UI Design Skill

This skill governs the aesthetic and interactive quality of the product. We are NOT building utilities; we are building *experiences*.

## 1. Core Principles (The "Premium" Feel)
- **Whitespace is King:** Clutter is cheap. Premium means breathing room (padding: 24px+).
- **Micro-interactions:** Every click, hover, and transition must have a subtle animation (0.2s - 0.3s cubic-bezier).
- **Typography:** No system fonts unless intended. Use curated pairings (Inter, Outfit, Playfair).
- **Glassmorphism & Depth:** Use subtle shadows and blurs to create depth, not flat color blocks.

## 2. Implementation Rules
- **Tailwind First:** Use generic utility classes, but enforce a custom `tailwind.config.js` with our brand palette.
- **Mobile First, But Desktop Rich:** Ensure it works on mobile, but use the extra real estate on desktop for immersive visuals.
- **No "Lorem Ipsum":** Always design with realistic, high-quality copy.
- **Loading States:** Never show a blank screen. Use skeleton loaders or beautiful spinners.

## 3. Checklist for Every UI Component
1.  [ ] Does it have a hover state?
2.  [ ] Is the padding consistent?
3.  [ ] Is the contrast ratio accessible yet high-end?
4.  [ ] Does it look good on a 4K monitor and an iPhone SE?
