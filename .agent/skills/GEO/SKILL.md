# Skill: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

Expertise in optimizing content to be recognized, cited, and recommended by AI-driven search engines and Answer Engines (Perplexity, Gemini, SearchGPT).

## Core Capabilities
- **Citation Optimization**: Structuring data to increase the likelihood of being cited as a primary source.
- **Authoritative Grounding**: Formatting content with clear factual claims that AI models can easily verify.
- **Natural Language Intent**: Aligning content with how users pose complex multi-turn questions to AI.
- **Structured Data for AI**: Implementing Schema.org and JSON-LD optimized for semantic extraction.
- **Tone & Factuality Audit**: Ensuring high density of unique information (Information Gain) to stand out in LLM training data/RAG.

## Operational Logic
1. **Semantic Audit**: Check if the current topic has clear, citeable facts.
2. **Structure for Extraction**: Convert long text into clear sections with bolded key claims.
3. **Citation Strategy**: Propose linking to high-authority external data to "anchor" the content's credibility.
4. **Answer Engine Test**: Simulate how an LLM would summarize this content.
